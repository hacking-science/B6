This first session we will cover a basic introduction to programming and the raspberry pi, you'll work your way through programming exercises. We'll also show you some demonstrations of what you'll make over the workshops. 

## Session 2 :

#### [Sense Hat Project Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VYd2Ha07SDu10oSwsRey8_C4muYLWsSWd2Ou7cehz50/edit?usp=sharing)

Now that you have a basic knowlegde of programming and what the raspberry pi SenseHat is, you'll write programmes to create a clock, glitter and magic eight. 

All of the notebooks that you'll follow to create these projects can be found already on your Raspberry Pi. 

## Session 3 :

#### [Camera assembly Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zgKjPH1ebDKovIGiKce-QTBVKiipIoGuhm75EUjtyr8/edit?usp=sharing)

This contains descriptions of some functions that will be useful to you
when you're working with your projects.

## Post Sessions Material

#### [Installing Python on your Computer](./docs/guide_to_installing_python.md)
This contains instructions on how to install python 3 on your own computer

#### [Summary](./docs/what_you_have_learnt.md)
This contains suggestions on what you could next to further develop your coding skills.

## Projects


### Easy

#### [Clock](./docs/clock/section_1.md)

In this project you'll display the time on the Sense HAT.

#### [Magic Eight Ball](./docs/magic_eight_ball.md)

In this project we'll be creating a *Magic 8 ball* using the Sense HAT. If you've never seen one
before, you might remember it from Toy Story: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFOracFClBg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFOracFClBg</a>. It's a very simple toy: You ask it a question, you shake the ball (or Sense HAT),
and it'll give you an answer.

#### [Draw a picture](./docs/draw_a_picture_project.md)

In this project you'll learn how to draw a picture on the Sense HAT.

#### [Making Glitter](./docs/glitter.md)

In this project you'll learn how to make the glittery pattern that came on the screen when you turned on the Raspberry Pi!

### Medium

#### [Dice](./docs/Dice.md)
In this project you will turn the Raspberry Pi into dice that will show numbers from 1 to 6 when you shake it.

#### [Paint](./docs/paint_project.md)

In this project you'll create a simple program that allows you to paint on the
screen.
